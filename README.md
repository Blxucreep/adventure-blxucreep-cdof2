# Welcome to the adventure game!

Here is the first practical work in Decentralization Technologies. It is about an amazing adventure, coded in Python.

## How to play
To play, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Then, you can clone this repository. You will find three python files that we're going to use in order to play the game: *game.py*, *player.py* and *adventure.py*.

*game.py* is the main file. It contains the main loop of the game. It also contains the main function, which is the function that is called when you run the game. It is the function that will start the game.

*player.py* contains the Player class. This class is used to represent the player. It contains the player's name and the player's inventory.

*adventure.py* contains the Adventure class. This class is used to represent the adventure. It contains all the story that you'll be able to explore.

To run the game, use the following command: `python game.py`.
